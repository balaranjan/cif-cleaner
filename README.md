`CIF Cleaner` is an interactive and codeless program for sorting,
pre-processing, and parsing CIF (Crystallographic Information File) files. It
extracts information from `.cif` files in a folder containing such files.

`CIF Cleaner` is built using the `cifkit` package:
https://github.com/bobleesj/cifkit.

## Motivation

In high-throughput analysis, we extract `.cif` files from databases, sorting
them based on specific attributes. `CIF Cleaner` was developed to streamline
this process by utilizing interactive prompts.

This tool is used by both undergraduate and graduate researchers in the Oliynyk
research group at CUNY Hunter College.

## Getting started

Open your terminal or command-line interface:

1. Clone the repository and enter the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bobleesj/cif-cleaner.git
cd cif-cleaner
```

2. Install dependencies from the requirements.txt file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the program:

```bash
python main.py
```

The program automatically detects folders containing .cif files at the project
level.

```text
Welcome! Please choose an option to proceed:
[1] Move files based on unsupported format after pre-formatting
[2] Move files based on unreasonable distance
[3] Move files based on supercell atom count
[4] Move files based on tags
[5] Copy files based on atomic occupancy and mixing
[6] Get file info in the folder

Enter your choice (1-6): 6
You have chosen: Get file info in the folder

Available folders containing CIF files:
1. 20240706_test, 9 files

Enter the number corresponding to the folder containing .cif files:
```

## **Options**

| Option | Description                                                                      | User Input                               |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1      | Standardize and relocate .cif files that do not comply with the expected format. | N/S                                      |
| 2      | Relocate .cif files based on the minimum distance threshold.                     | Minimum distance threshold (e.g., 2.0 Å) |
| 3      | Relocate .cif files based on supercell size.                                     | Minimum and maximum atom count           |
| 4      | Relocate .cif files based on specific tags.                                      | N/S                                      |
| 5      | Copy .cif files that meet criteria for atomic occupancy and atomic mixing.       | N/S                                      |
| 6      | Retrieve information from .cif files and save as a CSV file.                     | N/S                                      |

### Option 2: Filter files by minimum distance

For Option [2], the following histogram is saved in the folder. You need to
enter the threshold distance. Any files below this threshold will be moved to a
separate folder.

![histogram by minimum distance](assets/img/histogram-min-dist.png)

```text
Enter the threshold distance (unit in Å): 2
```

A folder called `min_dist_below_2.0` is created, and files with the minimum
atomic distance below 2.0 Å are moved.

#### Option 3. Filter by supercell size

A supercell is generated by applying a ±1 shift from the unit cell

![Supercell size ](assets/img/histogram-supercell-size.png)

The program prompts you to enter the minimum and maximum supercell atom count:

```text
Enter the min number of atoms in the supercell: 300
Enter the max number of atoms in the supercell: 500
```

A folder called `supercell_above_300_below_500` will be created with files that
meet the criteria.

### Option 6. Info

A `.csv` is generated containing containing information for each `.cif` file in
the selected folder.

## Other tools

In addition to `CIF Cleaner`, there are other interactive tools available that
allow you to extract geometric features and visualize bonding patterns from
`.cif` files. I invite you to explore these tools to enhance your analysis:

- Cif Bond Analyzer (CBA): conduct bonding, coordination, and site analysis.
  https://github.com/bobleesj/structure-analyzer-featurizer
- Structure Analysis/Featurizer (SAF): extract ML features for binary and
  ternary compounds. https://github.com/bobleesj/cif-bond-analyzer
